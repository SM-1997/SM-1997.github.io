    <h2>My Studies</h2>

  <section class= "section section-white ">
    <h2>My Hard Skill</h2>
    <p>I feel confident with <b>OOP programming</b> for both my studies and my work experiences. Infact during my university studies i mostly used <b>Java</b> (JDK) for my university's projects.
    Also i worked with <b>.NET  framework</b> (both C# and visual basic) and i am still using it today.</p>
    <p>I have work and university experiences with <b>Relational Database</b> (SQLServer, MySQL, SAP Hana).</p>
    <p>At the university i studied and applied some <b>Design Pattern</b> including Observer, Decorator, Visitor...</p>
    <p>Now i am studing the course about <b>Web Develop</b> provided by Start2Impact and i just finished the first chapter: <b>HTML and CSS</b>. <p/>
    <p>This site is my final project!</p>

    <h2>My Soft Skill</h2>
    <p>I worked in team and also as one-man-army and i definitely prefer the first one. I believe in communication and in my opinion differents points of views are simply
	  better than one.<p/>
    <p>I like to work methodically and by points. I'm a precise and meticulous person, i usually write all what i do, where and why. Maybe it's too much!<p/>
    <p>I'm used to work by objectives with deadlines (hopefully reasonable). I've a good problem solving skill and communication skill.</p>
    <p>I'm not the best programmer in the world and i will always have to improve my self, but i always try my best.</p>

  <section class= "section section-white ">
    <h2>My Work Experiences</h2>
    <p>I did my university stage in a software house located in Pistoia. My thesis was based on the stage-work: the dekstop client of a client-server SW
  	for the management of industrial production.
  	Before my degree i was assumed as <b>junior full stack</b> software developer in the same company of stage in Pistoia.
  	It's produces <b>Client-Server</b> software for the Management of automatic Warehouse, or in general Industrial Production.
  	It's use mostly .NET framework, WCF service for Client-Server communication and WPF for the graphic part.</p>
    <p>Now i am working as SAP Developer. I don't want to stop learn, i was looking for a professional course and after a long search a lot i found Start2Impact.</p>
    <p>That's it.<p/>
